title: Introduction to ifpd
---

The `ifpd` package aims to simplify the design of fluorescence *in situ* hybridization probes, starting from [databases]({{ site.baseurl }}/database) of oligonucleotides designed to *specifically* bind to genomic loci of interest.

The package contains tools to design a single probe, comprising a specific number of oligonucleotide sequences. Alternatively, it also allows to design anumber of homogeneously spread probes, covering a region of interest, in a fashion that we dubbed *spotting* probe. More details on these two [algorithms]({{ site.baseurl }}/algorithms) are available in the relative page.

`ifpd` is fully implemented in Python3, and is distributed through the PyPI network: the Python Package Manager developed and maintained by the Python community, for the Python community.
